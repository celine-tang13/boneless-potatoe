<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="MidnightBlue">Across the internet, you may come across the word called, "fandom". This word is used to describe the fans of a particular person, team, or fictional series (books and movies) regarded collectively as a community or subculture.</font></b></p>
<h3><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><center>Books</center></h3>
<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="MidnightBlue">Some of the most popular fandoms that exist on the internet are of famous book series. Some very popular book fandoms are: Twilight, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Hunger Games, Divergent, The Mortal Instruments, and other young adult novels. All these books and book series have gained many adolescent followers, but sometimes there can also be older or younger fans. These book series are normally recognizable with their teen love or dystopian drama plot that most of them follow, with a few exceptions from some of the more family friendly content.<b/></font></p>
<h3><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><center>TV Series</center></h3>
<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="MidnightBlue">Other than books though, there are also fairly large fandom bases for TV shows and movies. Like book series, most of these TV series also follow a dramatic take on either teen love, a dystopian fantasy, or both. Some book series have also been adapted into movie series and TV shows. Some examples of this would be Twilight, Harry Potter, and The Hunger Games. But then again, there are also big fandoms of standalone TV shows, like the Marvel movies, Doctor Who, Supernatural, and Star Wars.<b/></font></p>
<h3><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><center>Celebrities</center></h3>
<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="MidnightBlue">There are also a lot of famous fandoms of music artists, social media influencers, and celebrities. Some of the largest communities of fans probably belong to boy bands like One Direction, girl groups like Little Mix, and K-pop groups like BTS. Another really big fan group for social media influencers would be for YouTubers and Musical.ly stars. Other than this though, there are also normal fan groups for actors and actresses, like Leonardo di Caprio.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="MidnightBlue">A meme is an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation. It is usually a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users. For this one, it's too hard to explain so I'll just show you some examples of memes throughout the past decade.</b></font></p>

<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="MidnightBlue">Lots of fandoms and memes have risen from social media, but many internet trends and challenges have too. For example, there was a "trend" back in 2012 called the "Harlem Shake" where people would get their friends together and dance to a short excerpt from the song "Harlem Shake".</font></b></p>
<h3><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><center>Vine</center></h3>
<img src="https://vine.co/static/images/trademark_logo.gif" alt="vine" width="500" height="200">
<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="MidnightBlue">Vine was a social media app where users could upload six second videos that came out in the June of 2012. This platform was where many influenceres first got famous, like the Paul brothers and Liza Koshy. But in 2017, it got shut down due to failure to bring in money. All the previous stars and influencers had already moved to bigger, more popular platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube.</font></b></p>
<h3><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><center>Tik Tok</center></h3>

<p><b><font face="Courier New" size="4" color="MidnightBlue">Tik Tok is a social media app for creating and sharing videos as well as live broadcasting. There used to be another app just like this called Musical.ly, but it was bought by Tik Tok in August of 2018. On this platform, users can create videos of themselves lip-syncing to their favorite songs, or perform a small skit to it. But recently, there has been an abundance of trolls on the app, making fun of other popular videos. Two of the most popular challanges that is constantly mocked is the "I'm already Tracer" meme and the "Hit or miss" meme.</font></b></p>
